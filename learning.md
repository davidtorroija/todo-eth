- learn that we need to migrate like databases to update the smartcontract
- todo list json has the bytecode that runs on the EVM
- I can access the blockchain with truffle.console and check the smartcontract (It's a singleton or it's a new instance, the taskcount it's static or it's part of the instance? )
- I'm in the minute 24 of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzvk2kdjr2I
so once it's deployed for everyone to use that TodoList??
- I had a problem testing solidity I did just compile and console and I needed also "migrate" to see that changes on the truffle "console"
- now fixed bug in the html missing web3 dependency to load as an script
- rendered all the todos and understanding methods we call as we did in the truffle console but in javascript
- the firsts tests are working and I'm running through truffle "test" command
- question: the todo tasks are being saved as a array of the contract, or there are also new blocks on the block chain?
