learn that we need to migrate like databases to update the smartcontract
todo list json has the bytecode that runs on the EVM
I can access the blockchain with truffle.console and check the smartcontract (It's a singleton or it's a new instance, the taskcount it's static or it's part of the instance? )
I'm in the minute 24 of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzvk2kdjr2I
so once it's deployed everyone use that TodoList??
